# Individual Project - Data Science

## Introduction
The motivation and objective behind this comprehensive project was to delve and explore into the analysis of a dataset comprising various game-related attributes. The primary research questions focused on predicting game ratings, categorizing games into genres, and forecasting the number of plays a game might receive. These questions formed the tested hypotheses, driving the purpose of the research which use different types of models as well as some tools which are going to be explained below.

## Data Selection
The dataset used for this project contains information about various games, including features such as genre, platform, release year, and more. The data is sourced from [[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023)].

The dataset encompassed over a thousand samples, reflecting a mix of categorical and numerical variables. The decision to employ this dataset was motivated by its relevance to gaming analytics and the availability of features conducive to machine learning exploration.

Data preprocessing played a pivotal role in ensuring the dataset's suitability for modeling. Categorical variables underwent encoding using OneHotEncoder, ensuring their compatibility with machine learning algorithms. StandardScaler was applied to facilitate feature scaling, and SimpleImputer which addressed missing values.
