# Individual-Project---Data-Science

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to explore the possibility of predicting the rating of a game based on its features. The project utilizes Heroku as a platform for automatic deployment of a machine learning web app, Streamlit for web app development, and GitHub for version control. The tools employed include NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and inference, and VS Code as the integrated development environment.

## Data Selection
The dataset used for this project contains information about various games, including features such as genre, platform, release year, and more. The data is sourced from [[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023)]. The goal is to predict the rating of a game based on its attributes.
