# Individual Project - Data Science

## Introduction
The motivation and objective behind this comprehensive project was to delve and explore into the analysis of a dataset comprising various game-related attributes. The primary research questions focused on predicting game ratings, categorizing games into genres, and forecasting the number of plays a game might receive. These questions formed the tested hypotheses, driving the purpose of the research which use different types of models as well as some tools which are going to be explained below.

## Data Selection
The dataset used for this project contains information about various games, including features such as genre, platform, release year, and more. The data is sourced from [[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023)].

The dataset encompassed over a thousand samples, reflecting a mix of categorical and numerical variables. The decision to employ this dataset was motivated by its relevance to gaming analytics and the availability of features conducive to machine learning exploration.

Data processing played a pivotal role in ensuring the dataset's suitability for modeling, ensuring their compatibility with machine learning algorithms. StandardScaler was applied to facilitate feature scaling, and SimpleImputer which addressed missing values.

## Methods
  ### Tools
  - Sklearn: Machline learning library used for creating test and train sets
  - Pandas + Numpy: Data manipulation
  - Seaborn + Matplotlib: Data visualization
  - Jupyter: Development notebook
  - GitHub: Version control

   ### Methods used with scikit:
   - Random Forest Regression - it is a powerful machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees for regression tasks. This method excels in capturing complex relationships within the data, providing a robust and flexible solution for predicting numerical outcomes, such as game ratings and plays in this project. The choice of Random Forest Regression in this context is driven by several key advantages. Firstly, Random Forests are less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees, as they aggregate predictions from multiple trees, mitigating the risk of capturing noise in the data. Secondly, this algorithm requires minimal hyperparameter tuning while still delivering high predictive accuracy. The RandomForestRegressor module from the scikit-learn library was specifically chosen for its efficient implementation and ease of use, enabling a seamless integration into the project's pipeline. Despite its strengths, it's important to acknowledge that Random Forest Regression comes with its own considerations. Interpretability can be a challenge as the ensemble nature of the algorithm makes it less straightforward to trace predictions back to individual features. Additionally, the computational cost may be higher compared to simpler models, although this trade-off is often acceptable given the algorithm's superior performance in capturing intricate patterns within the dataset.
   
   ### Features
   - Use of **ColumnTransformer**, **StandardScaler**, and **SimpleImputer** constitutes a robust and comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline. ColumnTransformer, adeptly transforms categorical features into a binary matrix, facilitating their integration into machine learning models. Concurrently, StandardScaler meticulously standardizes numerical features, ensuring uniformity in scale and preventing any single feature from unduly influencing model outcomes. The inclusion of SimpleImputer addresses missing values strategically, offering a streamlined approach to handle gaps in the dataset. This orchestrated combination not only harmonizes the treatment of diverse feature types but also fortifies the dataset against common challenges, thereby laying a solid foundation for subsequent model training and predictions. The holistic nature of this reprocessing strategy contributes significantly to the model's robustness, adaptability, and capacity to glean meaningful insights from the given data.
